General Changes:
- Combined these two methods into one: create_copy_of_file_based_on_alphabetic_order + create_copy_of_file_based_on_word_length = create_copy_of_file_based_on_parameter

- Changed the name: encryptString() -> encodeString

- Changed the constructor in the File Encrypter and File Decrypter classes to the following:
    def __init__(self):
        from reader import FileRead
        from writer import FileWrite
        from basics import Basics
        self.basics = Basics()
        self.reader = FileRead()
        self.writer = FileWrite()

- Rewrote the program structure: Application -> Basics -> ModuleManager -> ALl other classes

- Completed all To-Do methods:

Tier 1:

- Wrap back around if the int the char is cast to goes above 126 or below 32  * May be incomplete

- Create another method called encodeData that accepts a list of Strings, encodes all of them, and returns a list of the encoded content

- Create an encodeToFile method that allows data sent to it to be encoded as well as written to a custom file  * Has a bug

Tier 2:

- A method that can decrypt a String using a given cypher/shift and then return the String

Tier 3:
